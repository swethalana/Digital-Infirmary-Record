# Digital-Infirmary-Record
“It is health that is real wealth and not pieces of gold and silver.” In today's time when most of us are running pillar to post to acquire wealth while neglecting our health, there could not be a better eye-opener than this quote. Good health is of paramount importance to any human as without it an individual cannot develop in mind or spirit. The health and wellbeing of the young learners is of utmost importance. With an infirmary within the university premises, a quick medical assistance can be provided whenever required. When copious students visit the infirmary, it is tedious to administer ins and outs of the infirmary. To ease this concern a methodology is being developed, which helps to manage all the data digitally. This project is intended to manage the records of a well-equipped infirmary in a renowned university. The key goal of this project is to computerize the details of doctors and patients which can be easily accessible when required. Digitalizing the data increases security, improves efficiency and emits problems such as duplicate records. This way we can integrate all the information about the patients , doctors and medicines into a single digital platform.
